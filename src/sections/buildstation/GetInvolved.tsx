                In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into broiler categories â€”
                founder, investor, or employee. Crypto allows us to be
                free-range and be all 3 at the same time. Our mission is to
                bring the benefits of the ownership economy to the creative
                class (rent your time for tokens, not dollars) while creating
                flexible and remote work opportunities for all members.
